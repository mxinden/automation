-- Minimalist automation / test engine --


## Principles

- **Configuration as code** - close to the code under test
- **Simple DSL** - no Turing completeness, nor full-blown language
- **Don't reinvent the wheel** - build on top of other projects like K8s


## Leveraging K8s as an underlying engine

- Scheduling
- Logging
- Storage
- Configuration management
